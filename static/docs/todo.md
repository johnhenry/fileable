## Todo

- Asynchronous content
    - Useful for extending
- Make work like described API in readme.
- Handle newline trickiness
    - inability to insert new lines easily
    - must manually add "{'\n'}" or enclose entirely witin backticks ("'``'")
- Eventually, get remote files working with using dynamic imports
